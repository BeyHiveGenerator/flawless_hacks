[Jay-Z:]
Yes! It's so crazy right now!
Most incredibly, it's your girl, B,
It's your boy, young.

[Beyonce:]
You ready?
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

[Jay-Z:]
Yeah, history in the making,
Part 2, it's so crazy right now

[Beyonce:]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
I touch on you more and more every time,
When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
Call your name two three times in a row,

Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
'Cause I know I don't understand,
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Your love got me looking so crazy right now,
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now

Your touch got me hoping you'll page me right now,
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy
Your love.

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

When I talk to my friends so quietly,
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me,
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress,
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress,

It's the way that you know what I thought I knew,
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you,
But I still don't understand,
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (oh crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your touch (you're in love) got me looking so crazy right now (love!)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now,
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy
Your love.

I'm looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy your love.

[Jay-Z (Beyonce):]
I'm on that now, let's go
Young Hov y'all know when the flow is loco,
Young B and the R-O-C
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only,
Stick bony,
But the pocket is fat like Tony,
Soprano the ROC handle like Van Exel,
I shake phonies man, you can't get next to,
The genuine article I do not sing though,
I sling though, if anything I bling yo,

Star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
Crazy bring your whole set,
Jay-Z in the range,
Crazy and deranged,
They can't figure them out they like hey is he insane

Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth,
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla.
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I've been iller than chain smokers,
How you think I got the name Hova?
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I been realer the game's over,
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Fall back young, ever since I made the change over
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
To platinum the game's been a wrap, one!

[Beyonce:]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this,
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me,
And baby you're making a fool of me,
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees,
'Cause baby you got me, you got me so crazy baby

Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your love's (oh love) got me looking so crazy right now (lookin' crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now

Your kiss (baby) got me hoping you'll save me right now (baby)
Looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy
Your love.

Baby I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
With you next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops
I am a seed
With you and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud
So proud to be your girl
You make the confusion
Go all away
From this cold and mixed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am
Baby you were my man
I know it ain't easy
Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny
I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you
Sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful to have you by my side

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love
To hold
To feel
To breathe
To live you

Dangerously in love
I can't do this thing
I love you, I love you, I love you
I'll never leave
Just keep loving me
I'm in love with you
I cannot do
I cannot do anything without you in my life
Holding me, kissing me, loving me
Dangerously

All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
You decided to dip but now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause I cried my tears
For three good years
Ya can't be mad at me

'Cause if you like it then you should have put a ring on it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh
Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

'Cause if you like it then you should have put a ring on it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Hold me tighter than my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I can't care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn
And now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me

'Cause if you like it then you should have put a ring on it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh
Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

Don't treat me to these things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost I'll be gone

All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh
Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

[2x]
'Cause if you like it then you should have put a ring on it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Wuh uh oh

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But, I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget to pull me back to the ground again

And it's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...
Halo, ooh ooh...
Halo, ooh ooh, oh...

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh oh...
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh oh...
